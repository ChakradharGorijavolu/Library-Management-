THE MAGICAL FOREST
------------------

Long ago, in a quiet village surrounded by tall blue mountains, 
there lived a young explorer named Arin. He was curious, brave, 
and always dreamed of discovering hidden worlds.

One evening, while walking near the edge of the woods, 
Arin noticed a glowing trail of tiny blue dust. 
The dust sparkled like stars. 
Without fear, he followed the trail deeper into the forest.

As he stepped inside, the trees began to whisper.
Their leaves shimmered with golden light, 
and fireflies danced around him like floating lanterns.

Suddenly, a silver wolf appeared from behind a mossy rock.
But the wolf did not growl—
instead, it bowed its head gently.

The wolf spoke in a calm voice:
"Welcome, Arin. You are the first human to enter the Magical Forest in 100 years."

Arin’s eyes widened.

The wolf continued:
"This forest is alive. It protects the world from darkness. 
But something threatens our magic. 
Only someone pure of heart can save us."

Arin agreed to help.

The wolf guided him to the Crystal Tree, 
the heart of the forest. 
There Arin found a crystal cracked in half, glowing weakly.

Arin placed his hands on it.
His courage and kindness flowed into the crystal.
A bright burst of light filled the entire forest—
and the tree healed instantly.

The wolf smiled.
“The forest is safe again… thanks to you.”

When Arin returned home, 
the glowing dust faded… 
but the memories of the Magical Forest stayed with him forever.
