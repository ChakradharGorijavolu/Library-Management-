ADVENTURES OF LUNA
------------------

Luna was a curious girl who loved watching the night sky. 
She believed the stars whispered secrets to her every night.

One evening, as she sat on her rooftop, 
a soft golden beam of light touched her hand. 
Out of the light appeared a tiny floating creature with blue wings.

“I am Leo,” the creature said. 
“I travel across galaxies searching for brave explorers. 
Luna, will you join me?”

Without hesitation, Luna nodded.

With a flash, they zoomed into the sky—
past clouds,
past the moon,
past swirling comets.

Their first stop was the Rainbow Planet,
a world where mountains glowed with red, blue, and purple light.  
Luna slid down a rainbow hill laughing with joy.

Next, they visited the Library Planet—
a giant planet full of flying books.  
Each book told a story of a different universe.

Then Luna and Leo reached the Star Giant’s Realm.
A giant made of pure starlight greeted them:
“Luna, you have a brave heart.
I grant you a gift—  
the ability to understand the language of stars.”

Luna felt a warm glow in her chest.

After many adventures, 
Leo brought her back home before sunrise.

“Will I see you again?” Luna asked.

Leo smiled.
“Every time you look at the stars,
they will speak to you.”

From that day, Luna never felt alone.
The universe was always whispering stories to her.
