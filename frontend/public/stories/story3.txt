THE HIDDEN CASTLE
-----------------

Deep inside an ancient forest, 
there was a strange rumor—
a giant castle that appeared only **once every 100 years**.

Kael, a fearless young adventurer, 
decided to find it.

On a foggy morning, 
as Kael walked through the forest,
the mist around him suddenly swirled and rose like smoke.  
Through the fog, the castle appeared—  
tall, silent, and glowing faintly blue.

Kael pushed the massive doors open.
They weren’t locked.
It was as if the castle *expected* him.

Inside, everything was alive:
Paintings moved.
Stairs shifted.
Candles flickered without wind.

A tiny voice whispered:
“Help me…”

Kael followed the voice into a grand library.
There he found a girl named Mira—  
trapped inside a floating crystal.

Mira explained:
“A powerful spell froze me here. 
Only someone with courage can break it.”

Kael placed his hand on the crystal.
The castle trembled.
Golden light erupted,
and the crystal shattered—
freeing Mira.

The spell on the castle broke.
Paintings froze.
Stairs stopped moving.
The fog lifted.

“Thank you,” Mira said.
“You freed me and ended the curse.”

She handed Kael a small silver key:
“This will guide you to any adventure you seek.”

When the sun rose,
the castle faded away into the fog…

But the silver key remained,
warm in Kael’s hand—
waiting for the next adventure.
